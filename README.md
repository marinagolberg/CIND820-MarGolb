# **Abstract**

Businesses these days are using every available platform to do marketing of their company, products, and services.Telemarketing is still the most used method of increasing sales of small to big companies. Predictive analytics uses data models, statistics, and machine learning to predict future events. It's a discipline that helps you to analyze your marketing campaigns, assess their efficiency, and see possible improvements to lead an increase in sales in future. This project focuses on predicting customerâ€™s response to a potential subscription of a term deposit account with Bank Marketing Campaign. The prediction will be achieved by using Machine Learning Classification algorithms with coding in Python programming language. The accomplishment of this research is to help the company reliably predict future customer subscriptions before it occurs. This project will be able to answer the following questions:

- Will prospective customers respond "yes" or "no" to term deposit subscription?
- What type of customers are more likely to subscribe to term deposit and which feature has higher influence?
- What is the best time of year for a marketing campaign?
